## Serialization

<br />

**Serialization in Java** converts objects into a sequence of bytes, which can then be saved to a disk or transmitted over a network. For an object to be serializable, its class must implement the **`java.io.Serializable`** interface. This signals to the JVM that objects of this class are eligible for serialization.

<br />

The **`serialVersionUID`** is used to ensure that the class version is compatible with the serialized object. When an object is serialized, the **`serialVersionUID`** value is included in the byte sequence. During **deserialization**, the JVM checks if the `serialVersionUID` of the serialized file matches that of the loaded class. If there is no match, an **`InvalidClassException`** is thrown, indicating that the versions are incompatible.

<br />

### What is `serialVersionUID`?

<br />

The **`serialVersionUID`** is a unique number that identifies the version of the class used during the serialization process. It helps ensure that the class being loaded is compatible with the serialized object. If the class version has been modified in an incompatible way (such as changes to the class's fields or methods), the `serialVersionUID` will differ, and the deserialization process will fail.

<br />

## Deserialization

<br />

**Deserialization** is the process of reconstructing an object from a sequence of bytes. During this process, the JVM checks whether the `serialVersionUID` of the serialized object is compatible with that of the loaded class. If the values do not match, the **`InvalidClassException`** will be thrown, indicating that the object is incompatible with the loaded class.

<br />

### Why Does Eclipse Issue a Warning?

<br />

Eclipse issues a warning when it finds a class that implements the **`Serializable`** interface without an explicit **`serialVersionUID`**. This occurs because, although `serialVersionUID` is not strictly mandatory, it is considered **good practice** to define it. Explicitly defining this attribute helps prevent future compatibility issues between class versions during serialization and deserialization. Eclipse suggests you define this attribute to avoid these potential problems.

## ðŸ“¸ "A Photograph of an Object" (Analogy)

<br />

Imagine you have a **photograph** of an object that you want to store or send to someone else. This photograph captures the **appearance** (state) of the object at a specific moment. In the future, when you want to retrieve the object, you use the photograph to ensure you are recreating the exact same thing. Now, imagine the photograph contains information about the **object's internal state** (like its colors, shapes, sizes, etc.).

<br />

**Serialization:** When you **"serialize"** an object, it's like taking a detailed photograph of the object's state and converting it into a sequence of data (the "bytes"). You can then store or send this photograph to someone else.

<br />

**Deserialization:** When you want to recreate the object, you **deserialize**: you take the photograph (the byte sequence) and try to **recreate the object**. But here's the trick: the photograph has a label (the **`serialVersionUID`**) that tells you the version of the photograph (i.e., the state of the object when the picture was taken). If the version of the photo you have does not match the version of the class you are using to recreate the object, it's like trying to use a picture of an old object to recreate a new, modified object. This would cause an error.

<br />

**The Role of `serialVersionUID`:** The **`serialVersionUID`** acts like a unique serial number for the photograph (or class version). It helps ensure that the version of the photograph you have is compatible with the version of the object you are trying to recreate. If you make changes to the object (e.g., change its color or size), you'll want to update the serial number on the photograph to indicate that it's no longer the previous version.

| **Serialization**      | Taking a photograph of the object      | Converting the object's state into data (bytes).             |

| **`serialVersionUID`** | The serial number on the photo         | Ensures the version of the data is compatible with the version of the class. |
